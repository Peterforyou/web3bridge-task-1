### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt how to apply one class to multiple divs and style them once than having multiple classes and styles, it was interesting building this project.


```html
 <div class="box">box
```
```css
 .box {
    width: 700px;
    font-size: 14px;
  }
```
### Continued development    

I would be focusing more on CSS flexbox especially when it comes to flexing multiple boxes with same class since i havent't been grinded on it.
