## Overview
This is a task from Frontend Mentor to build a 3-column preview card componet to aid my proficiency in learning Css flexbox.

### The challenge
The challenge is to build out this 3-column preview card component and get it looking as close to the design given as possible.

Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt how to aplly one class to multiple divs and style them once than having multiple classes and styles, it was interesting building this project.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
 <div class="box">box
```
```css
 .box {
    width: 700px;
    font-size: 14px;
  }
```

### Continued development    

I would love focusing more on Css flexbox especially when it comes to flexing multiple boxes with same class since i havent't been grinded on it.
